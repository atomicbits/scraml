           Using the Twilio REST API, you can make outgoing calls to phones,
           SIP-enabled endpoints and Twilio Client connections.

           Note that calls initiated via the REST API are rate-limited to one per
           second. You can queue up as many calls as you like as fast as you like,
           but each call is popped off the queue at a rate of one per second.
