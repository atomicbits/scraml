     The post body must include the _URL_ of the video to process. It may
     also include output settings for the job, including an output
     destination, notification settings, and transcoding settings.

     We currently support downloading files using HTTP/HTTPS, S3,
     Cloud Files, FTP/FTPS, SFTP, and Aspera.

     When you create a new encoding job through the API, our server
     will immediately respond with details about the job and output
     files being created. You should store the job and outputs IDs
     to track them through the encoding process.
