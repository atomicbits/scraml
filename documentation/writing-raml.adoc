section will teach you some basics to get you started.

=== Resource definitions and json-schema

In code listing <<raml-simple>>, we see a resource hosted on `\rest\user` that provides a `GET` action that takes two query parameters
`firstName` and `lastName`. The resulting body has a result type `application/json` that matches the expected accept header and refers
to the JSON data this service returns. This JSON data is further defined by the type `User`.
